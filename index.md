# Integrated Embedded Systems

Welcome to the course material for MEC4126F - Integrated Embedded Systems. This course is designed to give the student a practical introduction to the design and implementation of embedded systems in the context of physical measurement and control systems.

The course is broken into two main sections:

1. Analogue Electronics
2. Microcontroller Programming

In the first section we will cover the basics of analogue electronics, including the operation of BJTs, MOSFETs, op-amps, filters, and feedback, focussing on the elements of these that are important for the design and implementation of measurement and control systems.

The second section will cover the basics of microcontroller programming, including the operation of GPIOs, ADCs, Timers, and wired communication protocols. These topics will be integrated with the analogue electronics topics to allow the design and implementation of integratedmeasurement and control systems. The microcontroller used in this section will be the STM32F051C6T6 microcontroller as integrated onto the UCT Development Board designed by the Department of Electrical Engineering at UCT.
